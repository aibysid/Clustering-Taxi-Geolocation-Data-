# Clustering-Taxi-Geolocation-Data-
In this project I use algorithms like DBSCAN(Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) , HDBSCAN( Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)  and K means Clustering to cluster geolocation of taxis in the city of johannesburg South Africa to Identify area where taxis are more likely to be found.I am glad you stumbled to this repo any contribution and improvement is greatly welcome feel free for suggesting any improvement.
